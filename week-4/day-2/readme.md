# Mini-assignments
## Week 4: Day 2

### Instructions for today

- This is an _individual_ exercise. However, you will be giving feedback to the other members of your _**peer code-review**_  group on the solutions they present, as well as receiving feedback from them.
- Create a public repo in your Github profile. This project should be part of your personal portfolio.

### Peer code-review

- The last 10 minutes of the period are assigned to provide feedback to your **peer code-review** team. Use Github's review feature to comment on their code within the _pull requests_.
- Use the last 5 minutes to review the comments from your peers. Based on their feedback, do you think you need to make changes to your code? Go ahead and do so!
- By the end of this 15-minute period, make sure your changes are reflected in your PR.

Great job! ðŸ™Œ
